# TodoMVC Yafrl

This is an implementation of [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/) using [yafrl](https://github.com/yafrl/yafrl) and [Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform).

This project uses the HTML Compose library and was forked from the [Compose Multiplatform HTML](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-html-library-template/) template.

- `./gradlew jsBrowserRun` - run application in a browser
- `./gradlew jsBrowserProductionWebpack` - produce the output in `build/dist`
